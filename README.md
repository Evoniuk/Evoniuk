# Jack Evoniuk

I'm an incurably curious person who needs every assumption justified. 

My main interests include

- Literature (especially Russian)
- History (especially Russian)
- Languages (especially Russian)
- Computers (especially ~~Russian~~ low-level stuff)
- Writing (mostly technical, but also creative)
- Math (especially calculus and formal logic)
- Music Theory (Even though music's been going downhill since 1750)
