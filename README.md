# Jack Evoniuk

I'm an incurably curious person who needs every assumption justified. 

My main interests include

- Literature (especially Russian)
- History (especially Russian)
- Languages (especially Russian)
- Computers (especially ~~Russian~~ low-level stuff)
- Writing (mostly technical, but also creative)
- Math (especially calculus and formal logic)
- Music and Music Theory (even though music's been going downhill since 1750)

I program mostly in JavaScript and C, but also do some Python and dabble in 6502.

Contact me with smoke/bat-signals, or at jack dot evoniuk at gmail. (I'm currently looking for a new job, so if you're hiring for a technical writer or software engineer...)
